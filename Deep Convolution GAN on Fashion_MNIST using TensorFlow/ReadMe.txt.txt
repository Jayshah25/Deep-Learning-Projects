The following folder consists of the implementation of Deep Convolutional GAN on the benchmark Fashion MNIST dataset.
The componenets of the folder are:
1. One IPYNB file that consists the complete implementation
2. One GIF file that displays the obtained results

Note: The complete implementation is done online in the Google Colab, and hence can be easily replicated online.
